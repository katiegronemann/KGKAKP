# KGKAKP

KG's 'Kick-Ass!' Kernel Puller is a Python Tkinter-based diagnostic reader designed for T, S, L, and Z series Bitmain crypto miners. An experimental project aimed at enhancing my understanding of crypto mining firmware and aiding operational tasks within the crypto mining industry.

To execute this program, simply install the dependencies required and execute the python script "main.py" which depends on "pycgminer.py." The other python files included in this repository demonstrate isolated tests of API functions.

This program leverages ["Pycgminer"](https://github.com/tsileo/pycgminer) by Thomas Sileo and Michael Overmeyer.
